# PhoneBook-Management-System

This C program implements a simple phonebook management system that allows users to store, search, and display contact information. It consists of three main components: a header file (phonebook.h), a main program (main.c), and an implementation file (phonebook.c). The phonebook is initialized with a user-defined maximum number of entries, and users can insert contacts by providing a name and phone number. If the phonebook reaches its limit, an error message is displayed. Users can also search for a contact by name, displaying the corresponding phone number if found or a "not found" message otherwise. Additionally, the program provides a function to print all stored contacts in a structured format. The memory for storing entries is dynamically allocated, and proper cleanup is ensured upon program termination. The program operates in a loop where users enter commands such as insert, search, print, or exit, allowing for interactive phonebook management while ensuring safe memory allocation and deallocation.
